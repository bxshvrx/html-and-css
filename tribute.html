        <ul class="list-of-time">
            <li><time class="time"><b>1815</b></time>-born in Piccadilly Terrace, Middlesex [now in London]</li><br>
            <li><time class="time"><b>1835</b></time>-she married William King, 8th Baron King, and, when he was created an earl in 1838, she became countess of Lovelace.</li><br>
            <li><time class="time"><b>1833</b></time>-Lovelace became interested in Babbages machines as early as 1833 when she was introduced to Babbage by their mutual friend, author Mary Somerville</li><br>
            <li><time class="time">1843</time>-translated and annotated an article written by the Italian mathematician and engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea, “Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage” (1842; “Elements of Charles Babbages Analytical Machine”). </li><br>
            <li><time class="time">1843</time>-Her detailed and elaborate annotations (especially her description of how the proposed Analytical Engine could be programmed to compute Bernoulli numbers) were excellent</li><br>
            <li>The Analytical Engine was to be a general-purpose, fully program-controlled, automatic mechanical digital computer.</li><br>
            <li>Babbage only built a small part of the Analytical Engine, but Lovelaces efforts have been remembered. The early programming language Ada was named for her</li><br>
            <li>the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honoured.</li><br>
